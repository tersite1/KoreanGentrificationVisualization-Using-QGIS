Creating a time series model of university impact on community infrastructure using machine learning and visualizing it in QGIS


Selection of community infrastructure development index:

Gentrification Index =
$$ Î£ (change in card consumption + search frequency + number of Instagram keywords - publicly announced land price) $$

(Z-score standardization in progress)


Korean shapefile and border Source: QGIS Developers Korea

Selection of university development index: number of SCI-level papers published


Goesan-gun and Boeun-gun in Chungcheongbuk-do were selected and applied to the infrastructure index.

Reasons for selecting Goesan-gun and Boeun-gun:

* Similar population (approximately 50,000),
* It is expected that there will be no outliers in the same community
* Presence or absence of a 4-year university.
